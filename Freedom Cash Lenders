A poll of payday loan borrowers, which also appears in the latest report, indicates support for such reform. The nationally representative survey of payday loan borrowers reveals that an overwhelming 9 in 10 support a system of installment payments over time instead of the conventional lump-sum-repayment structure. Moreover, 8 in 10 favor payments that fit consumers' budgets by taking a more manageable amount of each paycheck.

“People who use payday loans are struggling,” Bourke added. “Most are paying bank overdraft fees, most carry credit card or other debt, and almost all have credit scores at the low end of the scale. Evidence shows that lump-sum payday loans harm consumers compared with loans that have affordable payments. It is possible to make this market work better for borrowers in a way that is viable for lenders.
